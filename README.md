# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room Client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company that created a game called Draw It or Lose It in the form of an Android app. They wanted to expand on the game and make it into a web-based application that serves on multiple platforms.  

# What did you do particularly well in developing this document?
What I did particularly well in developing this document was addressing and explaining the overall summary of the client, as well as the design constraints for developing the web-based application. It's important in clearly communicating these topics because it lays a foundation of what is expected for the final version of the game and what could possibly be a roadblock. 

# What about the process of working throught the design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
What I found helpful when developing the code is the domain model section. This clearly showed and explained what classes there were, how they were related to each other, and what variables and functions existed in those classes. It showed if the variables and functions were private or public, which is important for aspects like inheritance and encapsulation. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part of the document I would revise would be the evaluation section. I feel like I could dive deeper and learn more about each operating system, what advantages and disadvantages they have to offer, and any features that would be helpful with this project.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
With the application being developed for the web browser, there are important things to consider such as loading speed, responsivness on all devices, and proper UI/UX design. We made sure these aspects were identified and implemented. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing applications because they are the ones using it the most. They're the ones experiencing the full functionality and it's important that everything operates properly and smoothly. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
We approached it by identifying the clients needs and wants, recording everything that is needed to properly design and develop the application in a document as well as everything that needs to be considered such as the different types of operating systems that will run the application. I would take a similar approach to designing future software applications. Everything that was gathered was helpful and carefully thought over. The executive summary, design constraints, domain model, evaluation, and recommendations were all necessary in the successful completion of the project.
